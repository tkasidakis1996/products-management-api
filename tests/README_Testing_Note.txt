Please note that while I have covered the majority of API functionality through tests, there are some scenarios related to connection or database errors that are not explicitly tested.

To simulate such cases, mocking techniques should be applied to replicate failures in a controlled manner. Due to time constraints, I was unable to implement these tests, but I fully understand their importance in a comprehensive test suite.

Kind regards,
